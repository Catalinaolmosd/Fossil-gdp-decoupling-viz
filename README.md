# Fossil Fuel Dependency and Economic Growth 🌍

This repository presents a small set of data-driven visual analyses examining how fossil fuel dependence relates to population scale and economic development across countries.

The figures use harmonized national energy data from the Our World in Data Energy dataset to explore structural patterns in fossil fuel use, scale effects, and long-run trajectories relevant to global decarbonization policy debates.

## Included Visualizations

1. **📊 Figure 1 Population, Fossil Fuel Share, and Total Fossil Consumption (2022)** 

This visualization explores whether population size is related to fossil fuel dependence across countries, and how absolute fossil fuel consumption emerges from the interaction between population scale and energy mix structure.

X-axis: Fossil fuel share of primary energy (%)

Y-axis: Population (millions, logarithmic scale)

Bubble size: Total fossil fuel consumption (primary energy, TWh)

Data year: 2022

The figure shows that population size alone does not explain fossil fuel dependence—countries of all population sizes cluster across similar fossil fuel shares. However, total fossil fuel consumption is strongly driven by the combination of high population and high fossil fuel share, which explains why a small number of large economies dominate global fossil energy use.

2. **📊 Figure 2 Economic Growth and Fossil Fuel Consumption Trajectories (1990–latest)** 

This figure examines how fossil fuel consumption per capita evolves with economic growth over time, and whether higher income levels are associated with lower fossil energy dependence.

X-axis: GDP per capita (USD, log scale)

Y-axis: Fossil fuel consumption per capita (MWh/person, log scale)

Bubble size: Total fossil fuel consumption (primary energy, TWh)

Time dimension: Annual data from 1990 to the latest available year (animated)

Highlighted countries: China, India, United States, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Germany, Japan

The animated trajectories show that economic growth is generally associated with rising fossil energy use per capita, especially during industrialization phases. At higher income levels, fossil consumption per capita tends to plateau rather than decline, indicating limited evidence of automatic decoupling between income growth and fossil energy use.

Outliers are analytically informative:

Hydro- and geothermal-rich countries (e.g., Norway) achieve high income with relatively moderate fossil use.

Energy-exporting economies (e.g., Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE) display extremely high per-capita fossil consumption despite small populations.

Large emerging economies (China, India) follow distinct upward trajectories driven by scale, industrial structure, and energy access expansion.

Overall, the figure highlights that structural energy system characteristics and policy choices matter more than income alone in shaping fossil fuel dependence, with important implications for global decarbonization pathways.
